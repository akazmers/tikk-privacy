  <h1>TIKK — Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 24, 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>TIKK ("we", "our", "the app") is a focus timer and productivity application available on Android. We respect your
    privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>TIKK stores your settings, focus statistics, session history, and purchase status <strong>locally on your
      device</strong> using browser localStorage. This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any
    server we operate.</p>
  <p>When you use the app, third-party services integrated into TIKK may collect certain data as described below.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Displays ads to free-tier users. AdMob may collect device identifiers
      (Advertising ID) for ad personalization and performance measurement. See <a
        href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Manages in-app subscriptions (TIKK Pro). RevenueCat processes anonymous user IDs
      and purchase receipts. See <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">RevenueCat's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Play:</strong> Processes all in-app payments. Google handles your billing and payment information
      directly. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not store credit card numbers, billing addresses, or any payment details.</p>

  <h2>Advertising</h2>
  <p>Free users see banner ads and occasional interstitial ads powered by Google AdMob. Ads may be personalized based on
    your device's Advertising ID. You can opt out of personalized advertising through your device settings (Settings →
    Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization). TIKK Pro subscribers do not see any ads.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
  <p>All app data (settings, statistics, session history) is stored locally on your device. Data transmitted to
    third-party services (AdMob, RevenueCat) is encrypted in transit using HTTPS.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>TIKK is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe
    a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can clear all locally stored data at any time by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clearing the app's data in Android Settings → Apps → TIKK → Clear Data</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the app (all local data is permanently deleted)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To opt out of ad personalization, adjust your device's advertising settings.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
